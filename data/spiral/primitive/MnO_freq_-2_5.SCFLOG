                    DATA HAVE BEEN STORED IN FORTRAN UNIT 27

                 NOW RUN THE CALCULATION FOR THE OTHER GEOMETRY
                               (IF NOT DONE YET)
        THEN RUN A THIRD CALCULATION WITH THE KEYWORD "SPOLBP" / "PIEZOBP"

                 NOW RUN THE CALCULATION FOR THE OTHER GEOMETRY
                               (IF NOT DONE YET)
        THEN RUN A THIRD CALCULATION WITH THE KEYWORD "SPOLBP" / "PIEZOBP"

                     THIS CALCULATION REFERS TO JUST ONE OF
                THE TWO GEOMETRIES REQUIRED IN THE EVALUATION OF
                THE SPONTANEOUS POLARIZATION / PIEZOELECTRICITY

                    DATA HAVE BEEN STORED IN FORTRAN UNIT 27

                 NOW RUN THE CALCULATION FOR THE OTHER GEOMETRY
                               (IF NOT DONE YET)
        THEN RUN A THIRD CALCULATION WITH THE KEYWORD "SPOLBP" / "PIEZOBP"

                THE TWO GEOMETRIES REQUIRED IN THE EVALUATION OF
                THE SPONTANEOUS POLARIZATION / PIEZOELECTRICITY

                    DATA HAVE BEEN STORED IN FORTRAN UNIT 27

                 NOW RUN THE CALCULATION FOR THE OTHER GEOMETRY
                               (IF NOT DONE YET)
        THEN RUN A THIRD CALCULATION WITH THE KEYWORD "SPOLBP" / "PIEZOBP"

                     THIS CALCULATION REFERS TO JUST ONE OF
                THE TWO GEOMETRIES REQUIRED IN THE EVALUATION OF
                THE SPONTANEOUS POLARIZATION / PIEZOELECTRICITY

                    DATA HAVE BEEN STORED IN FORTRAN UNIT 27

                 NOW RUN THE CALCULATION FOR THE OTHER GEOMETRY
                               (IF NOT DONE YET)
        THEN RUN A THIRD CALCULATION WITH THE KEYWORD "SPOLBP" / "PIEZOBP"
